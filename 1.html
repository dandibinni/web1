<h2>When Will My Life Begin</h2>

<p>7 AM, the usual morning lineup
Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean
Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up
Sweep again and by then it's like 7:15
And so I'll read a book, or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit and cook and basically
Just wonder, <strong>when will my life <u>begin</u>?</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Then after lunch, it's puzzles and darts and baking
Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch
Take a climb, sew a dress
And I'll reread the books if I have time to spare
I'll paint the walls some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere
And then I'll brush and brush and brush and brush my hair
Stuck in the same place I've always been
And I'll keep wonderin' and wonderin'
And wonderin' and wonderin'
When will my life begin?
Tomorrow night, lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year
What is it like out there where they glow?
Now that I'm older, Mother might just let me go
</p>
